Tournament Mayhem
================

Characters are the core of the game and until the blueprint of a Character is finished we can't start anything else.

The 3 pillars of the game are: Characters, Networking(multiplayer-online-ability), and the Game Variant "BATTLE".
              
              The goal for now is to get the programming part of these 3 things completed (funtionally) before we start               the spring semester.
              
              Most of the programming will need to be rewritten and optimized after initially completed.
              
              Also, before the spring semester a goal is to have a few levels and characters completed.
              Again, "completed" means programmed and functional. We need to be able to demo the game for 3d moddelers                and animators etc...
              

Programming Help:

    sooooooonnnnnnn
    
    
We are using Trello to keep thoughts about the game synchronized and have an organized "forum" for all topics about the game. This includes everything from design to programming bugs and help. DO NOT DELETE ANYTHING ON TRELLO.

Also, if this game helps us get any bitches I get to fuck them first :)
