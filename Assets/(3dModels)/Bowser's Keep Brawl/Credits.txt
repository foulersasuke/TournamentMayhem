Bowser's Keep, Brawl-styled

Model and most textures made from scratch by Peardian using Cinema 4D and Fireworks.
Environment image ripped from Super Smash Bros. Brawl, to help the model fit in with the art style of the game.
Textures from other stages were used to create some of the textures for the same reason.
The Kinklink model was made by editing the model for Chain Chomp from New Super Mario Bros. Wii to ensure design accuracy.


Info:
I made this after studying the truly inspirational 3D artwork in Brawl.
With several models under my belt, I thought I'd try making an entire custom stage.
This isn't the first stage idea I have come up with, but this is the first one I have been able to see to completion.
The stage is divided up into pieces for easy management, including standalone versions of the statues.
I also included the color values for the lights I used, for those that want to recreate the atmosphere I envisioned.
And before anyone starts trying to hack these into Brawl, this has already been done by DemonSlayerX8 on KC-MM.

Like with my other Brawl-style models, I put a lot of consideration into how the stage would work.
The battle takes place on the chandeliers, much like in Super Mario RPG.
Since just having two platforms isn't very exciting, the platforms will occasionally move to spice things up.
They drop to the ground, being caught just before hitting the floor, then raise back up towards the ceiling.
I made metal platforms for the fighters to stand on, since the chandeliers themselves aren't very solid.
You are welcome to modify the bones.

I have never done any Brawl hacking, nor do I know how. Please don't ask me to help you.
